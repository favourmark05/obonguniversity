                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -The Elective Courses</p>
                    <p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grades obtained in all approved courses of a student&rsquo;s prescribed programme, excluding audited courses, shall be used to compute the GPA.</p>
                    <p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a student had registered for a course but the result is unavailable due to no fault of the student, no result will be recorded for that course and the student will re-register for it in the next academic year. The second registration will be treated as first attempt, provided the student formally notifies his/her Department.</p>
                    <p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedure for the Review of Scripts of Aggrieved Student Academic Grievances are treated on their merit. The Department runs an open door policy in addressing all manners of student&rsquo;s challenges for the sake of justice and peace. The most common is examination results; the student should lodge complaints and grievances in writing to the HOD, who would process the letter and forward same to the lecturer in question. If the challenge is outside the Department, then the letter is routed to the lecturer&rsquo;s HOD. In this way only the lecturer involved in teaching and examining the course alongside his/her HOD are aware of the emerging issue. Other academic grievances are usually handled by the respective lecturers with assistances of HOD and the academic advisers.</p>
