                    <p>The curriculum of this programme is designed to solve the immediate needs of the society as well as train personnel that will graduate to fit perfectly well into the knowledge based economy either as a player or a contributor as well as being readily employable.</p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>To train students on the principles, theories, practice and application of computer Science, which they can use to design better systems for industries and corporate organizations and also train others in the future.</li>
                    <li>To introduce graduates of computer Science to research techniques so as to sustain the growth of the discipline through further research.</li>
                    <li>To explore available human and natural resources in teaching, research and manpower development.</li>
                    <li>To expose the students to all aspects of studies, community service and problem solving skills in Computer Science.</li>
                    <li>To ensure collaboration with other disciplines and industries, especially in the area of ICT, which permeates all areas of human endeavor and</li>
                    <li>To fulfill the University&rsquo;s strategic plan by pursuing, developing and maintaining the linkage programme with other Universities/research institutes within and outside the country, in order to enhance the interplay of ideas and new discoveries without prejudice to maintaining a friendly and sustainable environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
                    <p>Graduates of Computer Science are normally indispensable in these modern days as virtually every transaction (business or otherwise) requires the use of computers. As a result, Computer Scientists are usually in very high demand in every industry be it manufacturing, banking, insurance etc. Computer Scientists are required for rigorous research/academic work, systems design and implementation, computer systems management and maintenance etc. Thus, Computer Science graduates have very wide scope of career opportunities covering virtually every spheres of business. Below are the fields of Computer Science a graduate can specialize in:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Systems Analysis and Design</li>
                    <li>Simulation and Modelling</li>
                    <li>Artificial Intelligence / Expert Systems</li>
                    <li>Database Management System</li>
                    <li>Wireless Communications Technology</li>
                    <li>Digital Computer Networks</li>
                    <li>ICT</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These fields have direct impact on the society. Thus the computer Science graduate can fit into any data/ information processing organization or industry; as he or she has been trained to utilize hidden skills and wealth of experience. he can as well be self- employed, and also serve as a consultant to all sectors of the society that handle data information.</p>
