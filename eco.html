                                <p><strong>PHILOSOPHY:</strong></p>
                    <p>The Philosophy of the Economics programme is to produce graduate Economists that are well equipped with qualitative education and skills, to become job creators rather than job seekers and to achieve some set of goals that would better the lives/lots of the populace. They are to answer what constitutes the good life which is a question as old as philosophy and humankind, one that must be periodically re-evaluated and answered afresh in the changing environment of the world society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department therefore provides the awareness that economics is a subject offering powerful insights about the world in which we live and to seek for solutions to the ever increasing problems that may arise. So, a major guiding philosophy of the Department has, therefore, been to emphasize a blend of theory, applications and policy analysis that brings economics across as the live of social sciences and for students to understand today&rsquo;s discussion of tomorrow&rsquo;s problems. Our philosophy in summary covers economic applications in relations to the theory upon which their solution depends and to be able to abstract using simplified models that identify the essence of a problem; analyse and reason both deductively and inductively and communicate concisely the results to a wide audience, including those with no training in Economics.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The objectives of the undergraduate programme are to produce graduates who possess a reasonable grasp of concepts, theories and techniques of economic analysis; who possess a basic knowledge of the facts and problems of economic life in the industrial, capitalist and developing areas of the world with special focus on Nigeria; and who are equipped with a foundation in research experience and an understanding that mainstream economics is either application or a normative social and political theory. It is hoped that the undergraduate programme will provide an adequate preparation for either a scholarly career or a career of responsibility in any other field where the knowledge and skills of economists are needed. In particular, the aims of the programme of the department of Economics are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>To stimulate students intellectually through the study of economics and to lead them to appreciate its application to a range of problems and its relevance in a  variety of contexts.</li>
                    <li>To provide a firm foundation of knowledge about the  workings of an economy and to develop the relevant skills for the  constructive use of  that  knowledge in a range of settings.</li>
                    <li>To make the student develop the ability to apply the analytical tools, knowledge  and  skills acquired to the solution of societies' economic </li>
                    <li>To equip students with appropriate tools of analysis to tackle issues and  problems of economic policy of Nigeria in particular and the  non- industrialized, West African and African regions in general.</li>
                    <li>To develop in students, a range of transferable skills that will be of immense value in employment and self-employment.</li>
                    <li>To provide students with analytical skills and the ability to develop simplified frameworks for studying the real world.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mode of Entry and Duration</strong></p>
                    <p>A candidate can be admitted into the B.Sc (Economics) degree programme either through the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) or Direct Entry. While the UTME candidates spend four (4) years on the programme, the Direct Entry candidates spend three (3) years.</p>
                    <p>In order to be eligible for admission into the programme all prospective students are expected to satisfy the following requirements:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>For admission into 100 level, (UTME) candidates must possess five (5) credits at SSCE, General Certificate of Education (GCE), NECO or its equivalent in&nbsp; Mathematics, English Language, Economics and two other subjects in not more than two sittings; and score acceptable points in the UTME in relevant subjects. In addition, candicates must have acceptable passes in UTME.</li>
                    <li>For admission into 200 level (Direct Entry), candidates should (in addition to having five (5) SSCE credit passes as in i above), obtain a minimum of two (2) A level (or its equivalent) passes in Economics, have an OND or HND or possess a good first degree in a relevant field as the case may be.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulations for the Award of B.Sc. Degree in Economics</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>The Department of Economics offers a B.Sc. Degree in Economics to two sets of students namely:-</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Four (4) year UTME programme; and</p>
                    <p>Three (3) year Direct Entry programme</p>
                    <ol start="2">
                    <li>In order to obtain a B.Sc. degree in Economics under the four year programme, a student must successfully complete courses up to a minimum of 130 credit hours and a maximum of 144 credit hours. At least eighty (80) of these credit hours must be in courses offered by the department (core courses).</li>
                    <li>To obtain a B.Sc. Economics degree under the three-year programme, a student must successfully complete courses up to a minimum of 103 credit hours and a maximum of 117 credit hours. At least 74 of these credit hours must be in courses offered by the department (core courses).</li>
                    <li>A student must take the number of units indicated in the programme per semester. A credit unit can be defined as one hour of lectures; one hour of tutorial; two hours of seminar; three hours of laboratory or field work; six hours of teaching practice and four hours of industrial attachment where applicable.</li>
                    <li>A student must satisfy the departmental requirements in his/ her selection of compulsory and optional (elective) courses. A compulsory (or required) course is one a student must take and pass in. In other words, no student who fails a compulsory course can be awarded a degree. An optional (or elective) course is one where a student must take but not necessarily pass in. This is to say that, a student who fails in an optional course can still be awarded a degree. Should a student find it necessary to leave an optional course taught in the department for another course taught outside the Department, the permission of the Head of Department must be sought /obtained.</li>
