                                <p><strong>PHILOSOPHY OF THE MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>Microbiology is a branch of biology that specializes in the study of organisms that are so tiny that they cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The organisms studied under the microscope include the bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa and the non-cellular entities called viruses. Much of what is known about microorganisms came through the pioneer work of Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek in the 16<sup>th</sup> century which eventually led to the discovery of microscope (a major instrument for studying them). Sadly, many people tend to associate microorganisms with infections that they cause such as Ebola, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, syphilis, as well as spoilage or poisoning or intoxication, and water contamination. However, an even greater number of microorganisms play important roles in the environment such as nutrients cycling in nature and in bioremediation. Bacteria and algae play important roles in photosynthesis: a food and oxygen generating process that is critical to life on earth. Humans and other animals depend on bacteria in their intestine for digestion and synthesis of vitamins that their body need. Microbes are involved in many industrial products such as enzymes, antibiotics, alcohols, acetone, glycerin, yoghurt, cheese, bread and vinegar to mention but a few. Interestingly, though a few cause diseases, they still help produce products that can help curtail these harmful effects. A practical knowledge of microbes is therefore necessary for medicine and related health science and in the industries.</p>
                    <p>The philosophy of the program therefore is to equip our students with practical skills and elaborate knowledge base that will enable them to visualize and work with microorganisms in the industry, environmental sector, hospitals and health organizations. The program shall also prepare students for post graduate studies by providing them with the necessary pre-requisite. Given the importance of molecular biology and genetic engineering in plants, animals and microorganisms, the program will also equip our students with basic skills that are essential to modern microbiology and biotechnology. Finally, the program aims to produce students that are well equipped to succeed in the modern world.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT</strong></p>
                    <p>The aims and objectives of the Microbiology department are:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>To produce students who are conscious of laboratory safety and knowledge in the handling, culturing and identification of micro-organisms.</li>
                    <li>To inculcate the idea of self-reliance to our graduates by training them to be skillful in the applied areas of microbiology that would equip them to set up their own businesses.</li>
                    <li>To equip the students with relevant knowledge and practical skills for basic research work, leading to technological advancement in Nigeria and the world at large.</li>
                    <li>To provide service courses to students of other departments and faculties.</li>
                    <li>To also provide services to the University Community and her immediate neighbours.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN MICROBIOLOGY</strong></p>
                    <p>There are many employment opportunities for graduates of Microbiology. The opportunities range from Animal/Plant Pathologists, Medical Laboratory Directors/Staff, and Quality Control Officers in food and beverage industries, Nigerian Standard Organizations, Environmental Scientists, Consultants, Research Fellows, and Lecturers. Others include being staff of National Food and Drug Enforcement Agencies (NAFDAC), Quality Control Agencies, Hospitals, Oil and Oil Servicing Companies, Water Corporations, Ministry of Environment, Paint Manufacturing Companies, Carpet Manufacturing Companies and Pulp and Paper Manufacturing Companies and self-employment. They can also be employed in sewage plants, pharmaceutical companies or be self-employed.</p>
                    <p><strong>THE STUDY OF MICROBIOLOGY</strong></p>
                    <p>The study of microbiology began with the discovery/invention of the light microscope by Leuwenhoek in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; The science of microbiology has evolved a great deal since then.&nbsp; It has impacted positively in industry, medicine, agriculture/environment, to mention but a few. Given the ever expanding role microorganisms play in these areas and much more, its study is now divided into the following areas listed below. However, it is important to note that our programme will emphasize the importance of microorganisms in these areas.</p>
                    <p><strong>AREAS OR FIELDS OF STUDY IN MICROBIOLOGY</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is an aspect of Microbiology that deals with the identification of causative agents of diseases, infection and immunity, spread of diseases, and their treatments. Subdivisions of Medical microbiology include Medical Bacteriology, Medical Mycology, and Medical Virology, and Parasitology and Immunobiology.</p>
                    <p><strong>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Health Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the study of microorganisms involved in the sanitation and sanitary practices like wastes management, sewage treatment and modern methods of water treatment. It also deals with epidemiology of infectious diseases.</p>
                    <p><strong>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the study of microorganisms and their interactions with the environment. This involves ecology of microorganisms, their harmful activities as well as their beneficial roles in biodegradation and pollution control, biogeochemical cycling of elements and bioremediation of our environment and petroleum microbiology.</p>
                    <p><strong>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the study of microorganisms and their roles in the industries. That is, the manipulation of microbiology for financial benefits. These roles include microbial products of industrial importance like beverages, enzymes, amino acids, hormone transformation, vinegar and other fermentation products, production of Baker&rsquo;s yeast, food and feed yeasts and production of other foods like single cell protein from microorganisms. It also includes an aspect of biotechnology which is the use of microorganism or their process to produce useful products for human use.</p>
                    <p><strong>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp; Pharmaceutical Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the study of the chemistry and microbiology of pharmaceutical products. It includes the principles and mechanisms of antibiotic sensitivity, resistance, mode of action and assay of antimicrobial agents. It also involves the sanitation, preservation as&nbsp;&nbsp; well as quality control of drugs, vaccines, and the skills of prolonging the shelf life of pharmaceutical products. Though a branch of industrial microbiology, it is expanding to include an aspect of medicinal plant studies.</p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food Microbiology </strong></p>
                    <p>This is the science of the production of foods with the aid of microorganisms. It involves the study of the principle of food preservation, spoilage, study of food borne illnesses, food sanitation and quality assurance to extend the shelf-life of foods.</p>
                    <p><strong>(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp; Agricultural Microbiology</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the study of the science of microbiology and soil fertility. It includes the science of composting, and behaviour of pesticides, biogeochemical cycle, microbial insecticides, agricultural products storage to prevent spoilage, and plant diseases control.</p>
                    <p><strong>MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND RULES</strong></p>
                    <p>The following rules have to be observed in order to obtain proper results and for the safety of everybody working in any microbiology laboratory</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Laboratory coats must be worn. Any unwanted material like apparels, handbags and briefcases should be kept out of the laboratory.</li>
                    <li>All microorganisms are assumed pathogenic until when proven otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Sterilize your working bench by swabbing with ethanol or methylated spirit.</li>
                    <li>Do not eat, smoke or drink in the laboratory, avoid bringing any food items, reduce talking during practical to minimize contamination of cultures through saliva. Use of GSM phones in the laboratory is prohibited.</li>
                    <li>Do not lick labels, instead use tap water.</li>
                    <li>Avoid the habit of holding pencils, pen etc. with your lips.</li>
                    <li>Keep the laboratory bench clear and scrupulously clean by using disinfectant (methylated spirit or absolute alcohol) at the beginning and end of the laboratory period.</li>
                    <li>Always work in an environment of sterile air by ensuring that a Bunsen flame is burning before you.</li>
                    <li>Report to the instructor any personal accidents such as cuts, burns, accidental sucking of any form of chemical or culture suspension.</li>
                    <li>Inoculation needles and loops should be flamed to redness before and after inoculation. This precaution minimizes the contamination of your cultures as well as the working area.</li>
                    <li>Keep test-tube cultures in test-tube racks; never lay them on the bench top.</li>
                    <li>Label all cultures incubated properly with your name (using masking tape), the nature of the specimen and date.</li>
                    <li>Used cultures should never be thrown into the dustbin or sink. They should be collected and destroyed by autoclaving</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands thoroughly before leaving the laboratory</li>
                    <li>All animals used for experimental work must be burnt and buried at the end of such experiments.</li>
                    <li>If you smell any gas leakage don&rsquo;t panic, rather report to the technologist or staff available immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAMME</strong></p>
                    <p>The undergraduate programme is designed:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>To create a sense of self-reliance and confidence in the students.</li>
                    <li>To equip them to be job creators.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                    <li>To furnish them with knowledge and practical skills necessary in a competitive labour market.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                    <li>To provide them with a knowledge base essential for research work should they decide to attend postgraduate school.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>From the above objective, it is clear that the programme is sufficiently flexible to permit a student to complete his/her studies in four years. Students shall be assigned to &ldquo;common&rdquo; courses that will be prescribed in the Department from time to time in addition to major subject area courses. Elective shall also be also prescribed. Students participating particularly in the mandatory 6 months&rsquo; student industrial work experience scheme (SIWES) within the duration of the programme are exposed to practical skills in the field of study. The programme combines theoretical and practical principles. It also offers sufficient background and depth to enable a graduate to undertake post-graduate studies in his/her discipline or related fields.</p>
